You: ^Tell me why the sky is blue?

Assistant:
Sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere and interacts with the gases and particles present.  Blue and violet light have shorter wavelengths and are scattered more effectively than other colors by these tiny air molecules (a process called Rayleigh scattering).  This scattering makes the sky appear blue to our eyes.
